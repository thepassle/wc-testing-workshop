# Assignment 4:

Accessibility is an important part of web development. As web developers, it is our job to make sure
our apps and pages are able to be used by all types of users. Some users may have visual disabilities,
and may use assistive technology like screen readers, for example.

This is why its important to also test your components for accessibility. Fortunately, we can
run automated accessibility tests. (Note: in real life apps, automated accessibility tests on its own
is not enough to ensure components are 100% accessible, and require manual testing as well. For this
exercise, we'll only implement automated accessibility tests)
