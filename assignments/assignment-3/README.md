# Assignment 3:

In `src/my-counter.js` we have added an event whenever the counter is incremented or decremented. The name of these events are `counter-incremented` and `counter-decremented` respectively. Both these events carry a `detail` property on the Event object with the new value of the count.

In this assignment, we want to test that the events are fired, and carry the new value of the count as a `detail`.

**Hint:** You will need a *certain* helper from `@open-wc/testing` for this assignment.
