# Assignment 5:
For this assignment, we have a new component. The component does an API call to the starwars API at:https://swapi.dev/api/people/

Which returns a list of characters as an array. You can visit the link above in the browser to see the API response

For this assignment, we would like to _stub_ the `fetchCharacters` method on the `starwars-list` element, andmake it return the following response:```[  {name: 'Luke SkyWalker'},  {name: 'C-3PO'}]```
