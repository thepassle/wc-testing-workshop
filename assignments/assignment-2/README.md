# Assignment 2:

In `src/my-counter.js` we have added a `reset` method. When a user increments or decrements the counter a bunch, they might want to reset the counter to 0 at some point. 

In this assignment, we want to test that the `reset` method has the expected behavior, and resets the counter to 0.
